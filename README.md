# Fuzzy-Infinite-step-Opacity-Measure-of-Discrete-event-Systems

The project provides an illustrative application of Fuzzy Infinite-step Opacity (FIO) Measure in estamating private protection mechanisms (PPMs) in location-based services (LBSs). The model-learning algorithm is out of the scope of this project, thus, the model, a fuzzy automaton, is provided directly.
